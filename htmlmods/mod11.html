			<h3>Scrum Teams</h3>

				<p>I found that working in a group while coding is beneficial, but it cannot be what you rely on every time you run into a wall. In order to gain the most meaningful coding experience, you must sit down and go through trial and error in order to really understand the code and what it is doing (or doing wrong). Going through this process is vital, and what is even more important is knowing that error is inevitable. This is the first step in becoming a confident, and efficient coder. With the knowledge that I gained from my own trials, I was able to help other team members on certain parts they were stuck on. For example, centering the text in divs, showing them the website resources used to create a nav bar, and just sitting with them to work things out are all ways I helped my team members. If I didn’t know something, I tried looking online at various resources or asking our professor. I also learned that asking questions is important, period. If something isn’t working, we want to ask why, and why again, until we find the root of the problem. With code, errors can easily bury themselves, and it often takes multiple checks in every part of the code to figure out the problem.</p> 

				<p>Overall, I found that doing preliminary coding in class was very helpful. When we created the basic website pages, it was better having multiple minds at work because often, one of us would know what the others did not. Coding out-loud was also very effective in learning the selectors and their options, and hammering in basic markup. Otherwise, I would have had to check back Codecademy every time I had a question when actually speaking with other team members helped me remember it better.</p>

				<h3>Class Time and Goals</h3>

				<p>I spent my class time very efficiently. A majority of it was spent talking with class members on problems I had with my coding. If my group members and I couldn’t figure out what was wrong with the code, I would ask my professor.</p> 

				<p>One goal I set for myself was to make my website look just like my high-fidelity wireframes. I wanted them to be perfectly aligned and with the same font and such so that it would look like a more advanced website than just the simple, plain websites we created in class. My other goal was to try and figure out as much as I could off of the internet when I ran into a problem. I realize that I might not always have the help of other coders to verbally walk me through my coding mishaps, so I wanted to be able to read online resources and know how to implement them in my own code. I believe that I accomplished these goals quite throughly. My website looks identical to my wireframes, minus the font which I had to change to a Google font. I also solved a majority of my problems through online forums, and only asked for help when it was absolutely necessary.</p>

				<h3>Resources</h3>

				<p>As I said earlier, I used online and in-person resources to help me code. For online I used the following sites: http://www.w3schools.com/, http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001474.htm, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ovlvYH782c, and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML. W3Schools was the main website I used for almost all my coding questions. It has thousand of tutorials, and explanations of basic HTML and CSS. Most of my in-person help came from my professor, who helped me when I came to my wits-end. Often, if we couldn’t figure something out together, just talking it out and trying to restructure the code would give me ideas on how to try something a different way.</p>
