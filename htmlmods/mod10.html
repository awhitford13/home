		<h3>Separation of Content from Presentation</h3>
		<h4>Abi Whitford</h4>
		<h4>April 15, 2015</h4>

		<p>
		I believe I have done an excellent job of separating content from presentation. I have an html file for each of the pages of my portfolio. On each of these pages I have markup that outline the structure of each page. Each of the elements(divs, headers, paragraphs, sections, articles, footers, etc.) has been put on the page free of design elements, or in other words, CSS. then I have a separate CSS file for al design elements that connect to all of my portfolio pages. It contains the basic elements, and classes and ids to create a more detailed and appealing presentation.
		</p>

		<p>Up until this point I have made sure not to add any presentation aspects to the html files. I find it easier to not have to go back and change each html page, and instead have all design elements amassed on to one page. For example, when I use the paragraph tags, I just leave it as paragraph tags with the written contents inside.</p>

		<p>Then in my css file, I add in presentation aspects like so:</p>

		<p>p{  font-family:â€™Roboto';
		font-weight:300;
		color:#a8a69a; 
	 	}</p>

		<p>This ensures that I can change the paragraph content on all pages simultaneously. I found shortcomings when I tried to make a class and id for every individualized element. That made things very confusing and pixels started adding up. By grouping elements together I found that it was easier to organize the html and design elements on the page. In my code, I also found it easier to keep track of what was where, and what that element was doing since there were now less class to keep track of.</p>

		<p>However, I understand that coding will only get more complex in the future. This means I need to be able to keep track of the multiple ids and classes that will build much larger websites. So in the future, what I think I could do better is add notes to my code. This way I could keep track of what design elements are doing what where in an html doc.</p>
